First, load all the necessary packages
````{r results = "hide"}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(knitr)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=TRUE)
```

Load the data

```{r, echo=TRUE}
rawstorm = read.csv("repdata-data-StormData.csv")

```

Arrange data base in order by fatalities and injuries
```{r}

by_fat_inj = 
  
  rawstorm %>%
  select(STATE, COUNTYNAME, EVTYPE, BGN_DATE, FATALITIES, INJURIES) %>%
  arrange(desc(FATALITIES), desc(INJURIES))%>%
  group_by(EVTYPE, STATE, COUNTYNAME, BGN_DATE)%>%
  summarise(fatalities = sum(FATALITIES),
            injuries = sum(INJURIES))%>%
  arrange(desc(fatalities), desc(injuries))

# cleans up leading whitespaces in EVTYPE

by_fat_inj$EVTYPE = gsub("^\\s+", "", by_fat_inj$EVTYPE)

by_fat_inj2 = arrange(by_fat_inj, desc(fatalities), desc(injuries))

```
